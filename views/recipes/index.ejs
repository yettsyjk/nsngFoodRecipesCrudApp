                    <h2>No Sugar No Grains #nsng Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p>What is No Sugar and No Grains (NSNG) all about?
Answer: In its simplest form NSNG is just that. You eliminate all processed sugars and all grains from your diet. In other words, you eat real food. In earlier podcast, it is referred to as being a “Carnivorous Vegan”. What that means is that you have lots and lots of healthy vegetables and meat in your diet. For vegans or vegetarians however, the concept is the same, but they just don’t have meat in their diet.</p>
                <p>What are considered grains?
Answer: According to the USDA, grains are “any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley or another cereal grain is a grain product. Bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals, tortillas, and grits are examples of grain products.”</p>
